# Problem-Solving-Practice

This repository contains problem-solving exercises to improve programming skills, particularly in Go language. The exercises cover a range of fundamental and advanced concepts, including algorithms, data structures, and problem-solving techniques.

## Repository Structure

- `cmd/` : Contains the `main.go` file which serves as the main entry point for the project.
- `training/` : Contains `.go` files for daily exercises aimed at improving problem-solving skills and understanding of the Go language. This folder is named "training" to reflect the goal of daily practice.
  - The exercises cover fundamental concepts such as:
    - Variables
    - Loops
    - Data structures
    - Conditions
    - Passing arguments by value and by reference
    - Etc.
  - Specific algorithms are also explored, such as:
    - **Backtracking**
    - **Sorting algorithms**: For example, bubble sort.
    - **Optimal pathfinding algorithms**: Such as Dijkstra's algorithm, Breadth-First Search (BFS), and Depth-First Search (DFS).
- `go.mod` : Go module dependency management file.
- `go.sum` : Dependency integrity check file.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/marou9916/problem-solving-practice.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd problem-solving-practice
    ```

## Usage

Browse the folders to find solutions to programming exercises. Each file in the `training` folder corresponds to a solution for a specific exercise. The `main.go` file in the `cmd` folder can be used as a starting point to run examples or tests.
